# PersonalityQuiz-iOS
## Summary
A personality quiz iOS application built using Swift and structured around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The app guides users through a set of questions using segues, with UI components selected for optimal user experience (e.g., UISegmentedControl, UIButton). A separate Results tab displays the quiz outcome using a UILabel, and closures are used to simplify callbacks and logic. Bonus questions like “Coffee or Tea?”, “Favourite Meal?”, and “Favourite Programming Language?” were added to personalize quiz results. The app ensures responsive UI using Auto Layout and smooth screen transitions via Storyboard segues.
